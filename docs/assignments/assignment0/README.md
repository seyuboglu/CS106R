# Python Installation

Hello! Welcome to the beginning of the course. If you have found this page, then you have successfully navigated our website and found the location of our assignments. The text that you are currently reading is on what we call the `README` file. These files are will hold all of the instructions that you need to complete each of your assignments.

... More explanation ...

// The real question (@Sabri): How are we going to have these kids use the starter code and then turn it in? 

Option 1:

Refer now to the files above this text. These are where you will find the files necessary to complete your assignment. Here you will see a file called `sample.py`. Open the link in a new tab and you will see a one line program. Click on the "Raw" button on the left section of the code, and then save the page given. Move that then into the desired folder.

Option 2:

Because this is your first time setting up your computer, make a directory for all of your assignments! Copy and paste the following line of code and fill in the sections marked `TODO:`

```python
print('Hello, World!')

"""
TODO: print out 2 + 2!
"""
```

Option 3:

We have the kids clone a *separate* public repo containing their assignments. We link to that instead of this repo Each of the kids make a pull request everytime they want to turn in an assignment and then we grade it via GitHub as well (then we can also use Travis CI, which can run unit tests on all of the submissions once they are turned in)

Option 4:

We have them email us their assignments (lol)
